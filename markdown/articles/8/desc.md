The Latin term ad infinitum translates to ‘to infinity’, which
is commonly used for sequences of numbers or summations that
never end. Attempting to understand infinity can be quite a
perplexing task. To illustrate this, we pose the following
question: what is \\(0.999\\ldots\\), where \\(9\\) repeats
infinitely many times? Note that \\(0.999\\ldots\\) is the infinite
sum \\(0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 +\\cdots\\)
