The Latin term ad infinitum translates to 'to infinity',
which is commonly used for sequences of numbers or
summations that never end. Attempting to understand
infinity can be quite a perplexing task. To illustrate
this, we pose the following question: what is \\(0.999\\ldots\\),
where 9 repeats infinitely many times? Note that \\(0.999\\ldots\\) 
is the infinite sum \\(0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + \\cdots\\)

Imagine taking the difference between \\(1\\) and \\(0.999\\ldots9\\),
where the number of decimal places containing \\(9\\) is very large but
finite. Albeit very small, the difference is larger than \\(0\\).
This might lead one to conclude that \\(0.999\\ldots\\) and \\(1\\) are
not the same. However, extrapolating from the finite to the infinite in
this way is wrong. In fact, \\(0.999\\ldots\\) is the number \\(1\\) in
disguise. This is not immediately obvious and can be challenging to
accept. Such a phenomenon shows the importance of logic in mathematics.

Showing that \\(0.999\\ldots = 1\\) is a simple exercise in algebra.
Start with \\(x = 0.999\\ldots\\), and then multiply by \\(10\\) to
obtain \\(10x = 9.999\\ldots\\). Thus, we can write \\(10x\\) as
\\(9 + 0.999\\ldots\\), and hence, keeping in mind that \\(x = 0.999\\ldots\\),
we obtain \\(10x = 9 + x\\). Subtracting \\(x\\) from both sides
yields \\(9x = 9\\), so \\(x = 1\\). But \\(x = 0.999\\ldots\\),
so \\(0.999\\ldots = 1\\).

This proof makes an initially bewildering fact suddenly seem trivial.
So does one now understand what happens at infinity? It is imprudent
to think so; we are always at odds with the concept of ad infinitum.
Proclaimed mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan, the subject of the
film The Man Who Knew Infinity, is said to have explained his
understandings as thoughts of God.
