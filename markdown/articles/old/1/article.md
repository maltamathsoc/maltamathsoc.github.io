two holes and behave like waves forming a surprising pattern

From toothpaste to washing machines, the word quantum invades
our gaze on a daily basis. Is there anything to this word
besides being a marketing tool? Well, I would like to think
so, but I study physics so maybe I am biased. Are these people
justified in calling toothpaste quantum? Let us think through
this and by the end you can decide for yourself!

In your head the word ‘quantum’ should at the very least evoke
images of Einstein, physics and maybe a cat. If this is what you
thought, then great because we can begin here.

Quantum mechanics is a particular area within the landscape of
physics; the study of how nature works at its most fundamental.
The game we play in physics is to think hard about something
and then try to develop some sort of equation which can
accurately guess how this thing is going to look like just by
knowing where it starts.

In the realm of quantum mechanics this is not the case. When
objects are extremely small like a Buckminsterfullerene atom,
which is around a million times smaller than the width of a
single strand of hair, these objects do not behave
deterministically. We will try and understand this with an
example. Buckminsterfullerene molecules look like footballs,
so let us try and shoot them through two slits and for
comparison’s sake shoot paintballs at two similar holes. We
will have a situation as I have sketched out above where of
course nothing is to scale.

The paintballs behave as we expect them, forming big splashes
through the holes. The same cannot be said for the buckyballs
that land behind the barrier. The only way we can explain
this is if we remember that quantum objects do not behave
deterministically but rather probabilistically like probability
waves. This wave behaviour is known as superposition.
Investigating the maths, we learn that each buckyball will
have had an equal probability of going through either hole.
In some sense having been divided and passing through the
two holes at once.

This is what it means to be quantum. To be so small that
the things which we know to be definite, like our position,
stop being definite and allow these weird things to happen.

Returning to our question, toothpaste certainly does not
behave quantumly. If I throw it at two holes, it will not
split between them. But, like everything else, its behaviour
emerges from being made of a gargantuan number of quantum
objects, molecules. Alone they are quantum but together
interact so much that they lose these properties like
superposition. This being said, I ultimately think that it
should be OK for a toothpaste brand to claim that its
toothpaste is quantum... so long as they provide a brief
description of quantum mechanics on the back of the box.
What do you think?
