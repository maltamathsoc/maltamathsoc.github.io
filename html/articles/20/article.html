<p>From toothpaste to washing machines, the word quantum invades our gaze on a daily basis. Is there anything to this word besides being a marketing tool? Well, I would like to think so, but I study physics so maybe I am biased. Are these people justified in calling toothpaste quantum? Let us think through this and by the end you can decide for yourself!</p>
<p>In your head the word ‘quantum’ should at the very least evoke images of Einstein, physics and maybe a cat. If this is what you thought, then great because we can begin here.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is a particular area within the landscape of physics; the study of how nature works at its most fundamental. The game we play in physics is to think hard about something and then try to develop some sort of equation which can accurately guess how this thing is going to look like just by knowing where it starts.</p>
<p>In the realm of quantum mechanics this is not the case. When objects are extremely small like a Buckminsterfullerene atom, which is around a million times smaller than the width of a single strand of hair, these objects do not behave deterministically. We will try and understand this with an example. Buckminsterfullerene molecules look like footballs, so let us try and shoot them through two slits and for comparison’s sake shoot paintballs at two similar holes. We will have a situation as I have sketched out above where of course nothing is to scale.</p>
<p>The paintballs behave as we expect them, forming big splashes through the holes. The same cannot be said for the buckyballs that land behind the barrier. The only way we can explain this is if we remember that quantum objects do not behave deterministically but rather probabilistically like probability waves. This wave behaviour is known as superposition. Investigating the maths, we learn that each buckyball will have had an equal probability of going through either hole. In some sense having been divided and passing through the two holes at once.</p>
<p>This is what it means to be quantum. To be so small that the things which we know to be definite, like our position, stop being definite and allow these weird things to happen.</p>
<p>Returning to our question, toothpaste certainly does not behave quantumly. If I throw it at two holes, it will not split between them. But, like everything else, its behaviour emerges from being made of a gargantuan number of quantum objects, molecules. Alone they are quantum but together interact so much that they lose these properties like superposition. This being said, I ultimately think that it should be OK for a toothpaste brand to claim that its toothpaste is quantum… so long as they provide a brief description of quantum mechanics on the back of the box. What do you think?</p>
